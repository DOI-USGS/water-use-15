DATA DOWNLOAD INFO

County boundary data were downloaded from NHGIS-IPUMS at https://data2.nhgis.org/downloads.

Downloaded data (8 GIS files total) were all Geographic Level = County, Extent = United States. Years were 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015. Basis was always "TIGER/Line +" but with a basis year of 2008 (1950-1990), 2010 (2000 and 2010), or 2015 (2015).

DOCUMENTATION

Documentation for NHGIS datasets is available at https://www.nhgis.org/documentation.

Recommendations from https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/boundaries.shtml:
  To join IPUMS-USA data with NHGIS boundary files:
    For states, the NHGIS GISJOIN code generally matches IPUMS-USA's STATEFIP code followed by a zero
    For counties:
      For 1950 and later samples, NHGIS GISJOIN codes can be constructed by concatenating STATEFIP and COUNTYFIPS codes, appending a zero after each FIPS code
      For earlier samples, the NHGISJOIN variable provides the exact NHGIS county identifier
