  # --- fetch --- #
  
  # See https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_counties.html for details on this file.
  # this file includes counties for places we don't need:
  #   Northern Mariana Island (STATEFP=='69'), Guam (STATEFP=='66'), and American Samoa (STATEFP=='60')
  # and also the places we do want:
  #   Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and all 50 states
  # Note that because we're fetching here rather than vizlab, and with a simple function,
  #   there will be no automatic updates if the contents of the Census Bureau's file change.
  #   If they do (unlikely), you should delete your local copy of the file and build again.

  # ^ very similar command is still in viz.yaml. we can take it out of there once we're computing
  # county and state dictionaries in this preprocessing phase, but for now we need the same file both places.
